Algorithm Quiz 1
 
<h4>Please answer the following questions by forking this project. Respond within the README file by editing it. Then submit your Github URL on Canvas</h4>
<ol>
 <li>What does sheevpalpatine.java do? You can copy the code from above and use a browser ide here... https://www.compilejava.net/</li>
 <p>The sheevpalpatine.java program prints the following output to the screen: false.</p>
  <li>Submit a binary search example by adding a file to this project after forking it. Be sure to explain how the example functions using comments or in this README.</li>
  <li>Is a selection sort or a bubble sort faster?</li>
 <p>A selection sort is faster than a bubble sort. Even though the bubble sort algorithm is more straightforward, and simpler than the selection sort algorithm, the bubble sort algorithm lacks the efficiency that the selection sort algorithm does have, although the bubble sort algorithm is stable compared to the selection sort algorithm, which is unstable, while being more efficient. In addition to the bubble sort algorithms inefficiency, the other problem with the bubble sort algorithm is its utilization of extra space for interim variable storage, as well as the need for additional swapping.</p>
